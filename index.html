<p> Nicknames are amazing! But automatically shortening a name is risky - someone might actually 
  prefer the full version of their name. In an attempt to establish camaraderie, you might be achieving the 
  exact opposite of what you are trying to do. When in doubt, ask! People will happily share their preferred name. 
  It might be their full name, or maybe a non-traditional nickname.
