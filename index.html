<h2>Hi &#128075; </h2>
<p> Nicknames are amazing! But automatically shortening a name is risky - someone might actually 
  prefer the long version of their name. In an attempt to sound friendly, you might be annoying them - ie the 
  exact opposite of what you are trying to do. When in doubt, ask! People will happily share their preferred name. 
  It might be their full name, or maybe a non-traditional nickname.
